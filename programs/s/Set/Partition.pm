=head1 NAME

Set::Partition - Enumerate all arrangements of a set in fixed subsets

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.03 of Set::Partition,
released 2006-10-11.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Set::Partition;

  my $s = Set::Partition->new(
    list      => [qw(a b c d e)],
    partition => [2, 3],
  );
  while (my $p = $s->next) {
    print join( ' ', map { "(@$_)" } @$p ), $/;
  }
  # produces
  (a b) (c d e)
  (a c) (b d e)
  (a d) (b c e)
  (a e) (b c d)
  (b c) (a d e)
  (b d) (a c e)
  (b e) (a c d)
  (c d) (a b e)
  (c e) (a b d)
  (d e) (a b c)

  # or with a hash
  my $s = Set::Partition->new(
    list      => { b => 'bat', c => 'cat', d => 'dog' },
    partition => [2, 1],
  );
  while (my $p = $s->next) {
    ...
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Set::Partition> takes a list or hash of elements  and a list
numbers that represent the sizes of the partitions into which the
list of elements should be arranged.

The resulting object can then be used as an iterator which returns
a reference to an array of lists, that represents the original list
arranged according to the given partitioning. All possible arrangements
are returned, and the object returns C<undef> when the entire
combination space has been exhausted.

=head1 METHODS

=over 8

=item new

Creates a new C<Set::Partition> object. A set of key/value parameters
can be supplied to control the finer details of the object's
behaviour.

B<list>, the list of elements in the set.

B<partition>, the list of integers representing the size of the
partitions used to arrange the set. The sum should be equal to the
number of elements given by B<list>. If it less than the number of
elements, a dummy partition will be added to equalise the count.
This partition will be returned during iteration. If the sum is
greater than the number of elements, C<new()> will C<croak> with a
fatal error.

Returns the next arrangement of subsets, or C<undef> when all arrangements
have been enumerated.

=item reset

Resets the object, which causes it to enumerate the arrangements from the
beginning.

  $p->reset; # begin again

=cut

sub reset {
    my $self  = shift;
    delete $self->{state};
    return $self;

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=head2 sum of partitions (%d) exceeds available elements (%d)

A list of partition sizes (for instance, 2, 3, 4) was given, along
with a list to partition (for instance, containing 8 elements),
however, the number of elements required to fill the different
partitions (9) exceeds the number available in the source list (8).

=head1 NOTES

The order within a set is unimportant, thus, if

  (a b) (c d)

is produced, then the following arrangement will never be encountered:

  (a b) (d c)

On the other hand, the order of the sets is important, which means
that the following arrangement I<will> be encountered:

  (c d) (a b)

=item L<Algorithm::Combinatorics>

Permutations, combinations, derangements and more; all you need
for your set transformations.

=back

=head1 BUGS

Using a partition of length 0 is valid, although you get back an C<undef>,
rather than an empty array. This could be construed as a bug.

Please report all bugs at
L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=Set-Partition|rt.cpan.org>

Make sure you include the output from the following two commands:

  perl -MSet::Partition -le 'print Set::Partition::VERSION'
  perl -V

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

Ken Williams suggested the possibility to use a hash as a source
for partitioning.
